Place a favicon.png image in here to have a favicon on the site!
 Place a 16x16 png in the data folder named favicon.png in order for a favicon to be loader.
 Then follow the directions on https://randomnerdtutorials.com/install-esp32-filesystem-uploader-arduino-ide/ to flash the flash memory.


 Note: Currently the flasher only works with IDE 1.8.5 and below.
So will need to load old IDE to update this file.
